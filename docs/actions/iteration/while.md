# Iteration While
While iteratively apply the values to the actions (inside the iteration) while resulting iteration value is true.

## Properties
```yaml
Max: Maximum number of times to iterate
```

## Output
```yaml
index-location: The location each index is stored
condition-location: The location where condition is checked for continuation
output-location: The location where the end result after all the iteration is stored
```

### Example
This is similar to following in Javascript.

Javascript example
```js
condition-location = true;
 index = 0;
 while (condition-location) {
 condition-location = custom_condition();
 index = index + 1; }
```
Resulting value-location is checked as continuation condition.
