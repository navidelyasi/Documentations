# String Character Decode
The character Decode action converts from one encoding scheme to the desired encoding scheme. This works opposite to the encode. It accepts the encoding of the encoding string to decode it and returns the original string.

## Properties
```yaml
String: The string that’s been worked on.
Encoding: Select the encoding scheme
```

## Output
```yaml
Output-location: Location to store the output data
```
