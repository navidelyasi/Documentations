# Solutions
The overall solution you create on API AutoFlow is referred to as the `solution`.

That includes the servers, endpoints, actions, and related data.

## WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) backend
WYSIWYG is a concept more commonly used in UI development.

API AutoFlow is a true WYSIWYG for creating a solution backend.
The user experience is similar to drawing a software flowchart. The difference is that after the drawing, the solution is ready for use.

The API AutoFlow WYSIWYG also follows the BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) standards, making it easy for even non-developers.
